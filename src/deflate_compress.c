 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This function builds a length-limited canonical Huffman code.
 *
 * A length-limited Huffman code contains no codewords longer than some
 * specified length, and has exactly (with some algorithms) or
 * approximately (with the algorithm used here) the minimum weighted path
 * length from the root, given this constraint.
 *
 * A canonical Huffman code satisfies the properties that a longer
 * codeword never lexicographically precedes a shorter codeword, and the
 * lexicographic ordering of codewords of the same length is the same as
 * the lexicographic ordering of the corresponding symbols.  A canonical
 * Huffman code, or more generally a canonical prefix code, can be
 * reconstructed from only a list containing the codeword length of each
 * symbol.
 *
 * The classic algorithm to generate a Huffman code creates a node for
 * each symbol, then inserts these nodes into a min-heap keyed by symbol
 * frequency.  Then, repeatedly, the two lowest-frequency nodes are
 * removed from the min-heap and added as the children of a new node
 * having frequency equal to the sum of its two children, which is then
 * inserted into the min-heap.  When only a single node remains in the
 * min-heap, it is the root of the Huffman tree.  The codeword for each
 * symbol is determined by the path needed to reach the corresponding
 * node from the root.  Descending to the left child appends a 0 bit,
 * whereas descending to the right child appends a 1 bit.
 *
 * The classic algorithm is relatively easy to understand, but it is
 * subject to a number of inefficiencies.  In practice, it is fastest to
 * first sort the symbols by frequency.  (This itself can be subject to
 * an optimization based on the fact that most frequencies tend to be
 * low.)  At the same time, we sort secondarily by symbol value, which
 * aids the process of generating a canonical code.  Then, during tree
 * construction, no heap is necessary because both the leaf nodes and the
 * unparented non-leaf nodes can be easily maintained in sorted order.
 * Consequently, there can never be more than two possibilities for the
 * next-lowest-frequency node.
 *
 * In addition, because we're generating a canonical code, we actually
 * don't need the leaf nodes of the tree at all, only the non-leaf nodes.
 * This is because for canonical code generation we don't need to know
 * where the symbols are in the tree.  Rather, we only need to know how
 * many leaf nodes have each depth (codeword length).  And this
 * information can, in fact, be quickly generated from the tree of
 * non-leaves only.
 *
 * Furthermore, we can build this stripped-down Huffman tree directly in
 * the array in which the codewords are to be generated, provided that
 * these array slots are large enough to hold a symbol and frequency
 * value.
 *
 * Still furthermore, we don't even need to maintain explicit child
 * pointers.  We only need the parent pointers, and even those can be
 * overwritten in-place with depth information as part of the process of
 * extracting codeword lengths from the tree.  So in summary, we do NOT
 * need a big structure like:
 *
 *	struct huffman_tree_node {
 *		unsigned int symbol;
 *		unsigned int frequency;
 *		unsigned int depth;
 *		struct huffman_tree_node *left_child;
 *		struct huffman_tree_node *right_child;
 *	};
 *
 *
 *   ... which often gets used in "naive" implementations of Huffman code
 *   generation.
 *
 * Many of these optimizations are based on the implementation in 7-Zip
 * (source file: C/HuffEnc.c), which has been placed in the public domain
 * by Igor Pavlov.
